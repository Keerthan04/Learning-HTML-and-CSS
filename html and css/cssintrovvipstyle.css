  a class attrbute can have multiple class names separated with space and in css we have different class

        ex: [href]{
                color: magenta; so here all elements having href the value of color of element will change

        <img src='/images/seasons/cold/winter.jpg'>
        <img src='/images/seasons/warm/summer.jpg'>
         img[src*='winter'] { so here all img ka has src attribute and has winter string uska change
            height: 50px;
            }

            img[src*='summer'] {
            height: 100px;
            }

/*
    Pseudo-class
    You may have observed how the appearance of certain elements can change, or be in a different state,
    after certain user interactions. For instance:

    When you click on an <input> element, and a blue border is added showing that it is in focus.
    When you click on a blue <a> link to visit to another page, but when you return the link’s text is purple.
    When you’re filling out a form and the submit button is grayed out and disabled.
    But when all of the fields have been filled out, the button has color showing that it’s active.
    These are all examples of pseudo-class selectors in action! 

    In fact, :focus, :visited, :disabled, and :active are all pseudo-classes. 

    Factors such as user interaction, site navigation, and position in the document tree can all give 
    elements a different state with pseudo-class.

    A pseudo-class can be attached to any selector. It is always written as a colon : followed by a name. 
    For example p:hover.
    p:hover {
        background-color: lime;
        }

*/

/* Specificity
    IDs are the most specific selector in CSS, followed by classes, and finally, type. 
    so if we have para with class and in css we have type selector(p{}) and class selector(.classname{})
    the properties of class will be taken as class is more specifice than type (id more specific than both)
    having more than just selectors will increase the specificity like p and .main p so use of chaining
    and specificty makes .main p more specific
*/

/*
    Chaining
    When writing CSS rules, it’s possible to require an HTML element to have two or more CSS selectors 
    at the same time.

    This is done by combining multiple selectors, which we will refer to as chaining. 
    For instance, if there was a special class for <h1> elements, the CSS would look like below:
        h1.special {
            so select h1 ele having classname  as special 
        }
*/

/*
    Descendant Combinator
    In addition to chaining selectors to select elements, CSS also supports selecting elements that are
    nested within other HTML elements, also known as descendants. For instance, consider the following HTML:
    <ul class='main-list'>
        <li> ... </li>
        <li> ... </li>
        <li> ... </li>
    </ul>
    .main-list li{ selects main list and from that selects li element
    }
*/

/*
    Multiple Selectors
    In order to make CSS more concise, it’s possible to add CSS styles to multiple CSS selectors all at once.
    This prevents writing repetitive code.

    For instance, the following code has repetitive style attributes:
        h1 {
        font-family: Georgia;
        }

        .menu {
        font-family: Georgia;
        }
    instead of this we can have
        h1, .menu {
            font-family: Georgia;
        }
    By separating the CSS selectors with a comma, both the <h1> elements and the elements 
    with the menu class will receive the font-family: Georgia styling.

    li h4{} and li,h4{} is diff first is li ele having h4(descendent) second is for both li and h4 use

/*
    Review
Throughout this lesson, you learned how to select HTML elements with CSS and apply styles to them. Let’s review what you learned:

CSS can select HTML elements by type, class, ID, and attribute.
All elements can be selected using the universal selector.
An element can have different states using the pseudo-class selector.
Multiple CSS classes can be applied to one HTML element.
Classes can be reusable, while IDs can only be used once.
IDs are more specific than classes, and classes are more specific than type. That means IDs will override any styles from a class, and classes will override any styles from a type selector.
Multiple selectors can be chained together to select an element. This raises the specificity but can be necessary.
Nested elements can be selected by separating selectors with a space.
Multiple unrelated selectors can receive the same styles by separating the selector names with commas.
