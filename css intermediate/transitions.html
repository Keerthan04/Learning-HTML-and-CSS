    CSS Transitions
    After a website is displayed, the visual appearances of various elements can change for many reasons. For example:

    Moving your mouse over a link may change the color or appearance of that link.
    Changing the size of the window may change the layout.
    Scrolling causes some elements to disappear and others to appear.
    With CSS transitions, we can control how these changes happen.

    These changes are a type of state change. CSS transitions allow us to control the timing of visual state changes. We can control the following four aspects of an elementâ€™s transition:

    Which CSS properties transition
    How long a transition lasts
    How much time there is before a transition begins
    How a transition accelerates
