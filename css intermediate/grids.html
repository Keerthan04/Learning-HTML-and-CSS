    Introduction to Grids
        Using CSS, you can elegantly lay out elements on a web page. There is no simple answer for how 
        best to do this â€” depending on what content you are trying to display, multiple different 
        techniques can work well. The Box Model and Display and Positioning explain some possible ways to 
        style layout.

        In this lesson, we introduce a powerful tool called CSS Grid. The grid can be used to layout entire 
        web pages. Whereas Flexbox is mostly useful for positioning items in a one-dimensional layout, 
        CSS grid is most useful for two-dimensional layouts, providing many tools for aligning and 
        moving elements across both rows and columns.

        By the end of this lesson, you will understand how to use these properties to create grid layouts:

        grid-template-columns
        grid-template-rows
        grid-template
        grid-template-area
        row-gap / column-gap / gap
        grid-row-start / grid-row-end
        grid-column-start / grid-column-end
        grid-area
