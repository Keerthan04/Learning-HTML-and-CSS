  Introduction to Web Accessibility
    Have you ever visited a website that seemed hard to use or navigate? Perhaps you couldn’t tell if an 
    element was interactive or couldn’t read some of the text due to size issues. Chances are this has 
    happened to you at least once, and it can be extremely frustrating. These problems that you encountered 
    were likely the result of poor web accessibility.

    Web accessibility is one of those aspects of web development where its presence, when implemented 
    correctly, goes unnoticed, but its absence can destroy the user experience. There are a variety of 
    considerations to make when making a website accessible, ranging from the size and color of the text 
    to invisible properties that are processed by assistive tools such as screen readers.

    Learning how to harness and apply the fundamental aspects of web accessibility should be a top 
    priority for any developer looking to build an amazing, inclusive experience for all users.
