    Functions in CSS
    At this point in our CSS journey, we’ve already been exposed to a few CSS functions—for example the 
    var() and repeat() functions. But the possibilities and usefulness that CSS functions bring are 
    much farther reaching.

    In a broad sense, functions are blocks of organized and reusable code that help to perform a single, 
    related action. Functions have the benefit of keeping code modular and allowing for a high degree of 
    reusability.

    Functions in CSS are a little more limiting than most programming languages. We cannot create our own 
    functions in CSS but instead have access to a wide variety of predefined functions, which allow for 
    expansive page styling.

    To use a function in CSS, follow the standard functional notation syntax:

    h1 {
    property: function-name(argument);
    }  

    Functions are a type of CSS value that is inserted in the place of a hardcoded value of a CSS declaration.
    Some functions can even take multiple arguments, generally each of which must be separated by a comma.
    see mdn documentation for many functions learning.
