          <h2>Saturday Market</h2>
          <h3>January 7th</h3>
          <strong class="opening-line">On Saturday, Dilara took us to the market.</strong>
          <p>It is a wonderfully eclectic mix of goods from all over the world - delightfully random. I dusted off my bargaining skills to buy a metal bracelet with camels on it, and Maggie bought a lapis lazuli necklace from Afghanistan. In the evening, we walked along Gulf Road towards the marina, passed through Marina Mall, and ate dinner at a wonderful little cafe that we will definitely be frequenting. I’ve developed a slight obsession with lentil soul... maybe it’s because I miss Foco’s Indian lentil chili.</p>

          </div>
          <p>We took a catamaran from the marina to Failaka Island, where we got to explore a bit, relax on the beach, and go swimming. The water in the Gulf is incredibly still; I haven’t seen a wave yet, and when you look out on the horizon it seems to go forever. Something about the color of the water and maybe the dust in the air make it seem hazier than the Atlantic coast. I have some cool pictures of the city skyline as we returned on the boat.</p>
          <p>That night, I hung out in a cafe with two friends, drinking traditional lemonade with mint. It’s delicious; maybe I should send in a flavor suggestion to Morano Gelato? Then we drove around the city for a while. Cruising around is a really valid way to spend the time when a tank of gas costs about seven bucks. </p>

  Relative Measurements
    Modern technology allows users to browse the Internet via multiple devices, such as desktop monitors, 
    mobile phones, tablets, and more. Devices of different screen sizes, however, pose a problem for 
    web developers: how can we ensure that a website is readable and visually appealing across all devices,
    regardless of screen size?

    The answer: responsive design! Responsive design refers to the ability of a website to resize and 
    reorganize its content based on:

    The size of other content on the website.
    The size of the screen the website is being viewed on.
    In this lesson, we’ll size HTML content relative to other content on a website.

    You’ve probably noticed the unit of pixels, or px, used in websites. Pixels are used to size content 
    to exact dimensions. For example, if you want a div to be exactly 500 pixels wide and 100 pixels tall, 
    then the unit of px can be used. Pixels, however, are fixed, hard coded values. When a screen size 
    changes (like switching from landscape to portrait view on a phone), elements sized with pixels can 
    appear too small, overflow the screen, or become completely illegible.

    With CSS, you can avoid hard coded measurements and use relative measurements instead. 
    Relative measurements offer an advantage over hard coded measurements, as they allow for the 
    proportions of a website to remain intact regardless of screen size or layout
