        </div>
    </body><!--will have the visible content on the webpage-->

<!--Can use <div> tag for division of content and have things under it just simply used for 
    division of content nothing else-->

<!--
    We can use <span> tag with the <p> tag to separate or highlight it
    a <p> with <span>Self-driving cars</span>. 
    This <span> element separates “Self-driving cars” from the rest of the text in the paragraph.-->

<!--You can also style text using HTML tags. 
    The <em> tag emphasizes text, while the 
    <strong> tag highlights important text.
        
    The <em> tag will generally render as italic emphasis.
    The <strong> will generally render as bold emphasis.-->

<!--the self closing tags
    we see there are many self closing tags 
    like source img and all in their openng tag at end we can add / or leave renders for both

ex: <img src="       " />
    or
    <img src="        ">
    both gives result better use / definng it as self closing tags-->

<!--head tag generally will have meta data of webpage it is not shown in it but info of webpage

    The <head> element contains the metadata for a web page. 
    Metadata is information about the page that isn’t displayed directly on the web page.
    Unlike the information inside of the <body> tag, 
    the metadata in the head is information about the page itself.-->

<!--Programmers use two tools to visualize the relationship between elements: 
    whitespace and indentation.
    Both tools take advantage of the fact that the position of elements in a browser is 
    independent of the amount of whitespace or indentation in the index.html file.

    For example, if you wanted to increase the space between two paragraphs on your web page,
    you would not be able to accomplish this by adding space between the paragraph elements 
    in the index.html file. The browser ignores whitespace in HTML files when it renders a web page, 
    so it can be used as a tool to make code easier to read and follow.
ex: <body>
        <p>Paragraph 1</p>
        <p>Paragraph 2</p>
    </body>

    The second tool web developers use to make the structure of code easier to read is indentation.
    The spaces are inserted using the space and tab bars on your keyboard.
-->
<!--IMPORTANT POINTS ARE:-->
<!--1.The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration should always be the first line of code in your HTML files. 
      This lets the browser know what version of HTML to expect.

    2.The <html> element will contain all of your HTML code.
    3.Information about the web page, like the title, belongs within the <head> of the page.
    4.You can add a title to your web page by using the <title> element, inside of the head.
      A webpage’s title appears in a browser’s tab.
    5.Anchor tags (<a>) are used to link to internal pages, external pages or content on the same page.
      You can create sections on a webpage and jump to them using <a> tags and adding ids to the 
      elements you wish to jump to.
    6.Whitespace between HTML elements helps make code easier to read while not 
      changing how elements appear in the browser.
    7.Indentation also helps make code easier to read. It makes parent-child relationships visible.
    8.Comments are written in HTML using the following syntax: <!-- comment -->
