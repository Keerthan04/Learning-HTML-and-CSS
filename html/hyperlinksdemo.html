        <!--a is anchor tag for creating hyper links 
            href in opening used is attributes-->
        <!--HTML attributes are data that can be added to the opening tag of an HTML element. 
            These attributes modify the default behavior of the element or 
            provide additional information about it-->


        <!--How to link to the same page but portions of same page by help of ids
            mainly seen in sites where staring all content given and on click go to
            different contents(part of same page) like intro and all-->
        <p id="top">This is the top of the page!</p>
        <h1 id="bottom">This is the bottom! </h1>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="#top">Top</a></li>
            <li><a href="#bottom">Bottom</a></li>
        </ol>           
    </Body>
</html>

<!--<a href="./contact.html">Contact</a> -->
<!--In this example, the <a> tag is used with a relative path to link 
    from the current HTML file to the contact.html file in the same folder.
    On the web page, Contact will appear as a link.

    A relative path is a filename that shows the path to a 
    local file (a file on the same website, such as ./index.html) 
    versus an absolute path (a full URL, like https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html 
    which is stored in a different folder). 
    The ./ in ./index.html tells the browser to look for the file in the current folder
    rather than looking at the root directory.-->

<!--within same href we put same file ka html file it goes to the same file like reloads-->

<!--Linking to Same Page-->
<!--At this point, we have all the content we want on our page. 
    Since we have so much content, it doesnâ€™t all fit on the screen. 
    How do we make it easier for a user to jump to different portions of our page?

    When users visit our site, we want them to be able to click a link and have the page
     automatically scroll to a specific section.

    In order to link to a target on the same page, we must give the target an id, like this:
    <p id="top">This is the top of the page!</p>
    <h1 id="bottom">This is the bottom! </h1>
    then use 
    <ol>
            <li><a href="#top">Top</a></li>
            <li><a href="#bottom">Bottom</a></li>
    </ol>
    this can be done for div many also just diff div also we need to mention the id then use #idname
