            The action attribute determines where the information is sent.
            The method attribute is assigned a HTTP verb that is included in the HTTP request.

        input tag-means taking input
            attributes
                type-different types used
                    text-textbox ka
                        It’s also important that we include a name attribute for the <input> —
                        without the name attribute, information in the <input> won’t be sent when 
                        the <form> is submitted.
                            <input type="text" name="first-text-field" value="already pre-filled">
                            After users type into the <input> element, the value of the value attribute becomes 
                            what is typed into the text field. The value of the value attribute is paired with 
                            the value of the name attribute and sent as text when the form is submitted. 
                            For instance, if a user typed in “important details” in the text field created by our 
                            <input> element:
                            When the form is submitted, the text: "first-text-field=important details" 
                            is sent to /example.html because the value of the name attribute is 
                            "first-text-field" and the value of value is "important details".

                            We could also assign a default value for the value 
                            attribute so that users have a pre-filled text field


                    reset-reset button

                    submit-submit button

                    password-for entering password
                            Password Input
                            Think about all those times we have to put sensitive information, 
                            like a password or PIN, into a <form>. We wouldn’t want our information 
                            to be seen by anyone peeking over our shoulder! Luckily, 
                            we have the type="password" attribute for <input>!

                            An <input type ="password"> element will replace input text with 
                            another character like an asterisk (*) or a dot (•). 
                            The code below provides an example of how to create a password field:
                                <form>
                                    <label for="user-password">Password: </label>
                                    <input type="password" id="user-password" name="user-password">
                                </form>
                            Even though the password field obscures the text of the password, 
                            when the form is submitted, the value of the text is sent. 
                            In other words, if “hunter2” is typed into the password field, 
                            “user-password=hunter2” is sent along with the other information on the form.


                    email-for email getting

                    phone-phone number

                    date-for getting date

                    number-to get number input
                        We can also provide a step attribute which creates arrows
                        inside the input field to increase or decrease by the value of the step attribute

                    range-to get slider
                        Using an <input type="number"> is great if we want to allow users to type in 
                        any number of their choosing. But, if we wanted to limit what numbers our users 
                        could type we might consider using a different type value. 
                        Another option we could use is setting type to "range" which creates a slider.

                        To set the minimum and maximum values of the slider we assign values 
                        to the min and max attribute of the <input>. We could also control how 
                        smooth and fluid the slider works by assigning the step attribute a value. 
                        Smaller step values will make the slider move more fluidly, 
                        whereas larger step values will make the slider move more noticeably.
                        ex:
                            <form>
                                <label for="volume"> Volume Control</label>
                                <input id="volume" name="volume" type="range" min="0" max="100" step="1">
                            </form>

                    radio-for radio buttons(each will have labels indi)
                        radio-has name attribute-all radiobuttons with same name belong to one group(name)and select only one among it
                              has value attribute-value it holds
                        radio buttons (like checkboxes) do not display their value. 
                        We have an associated <label> to represent the value of the radio button. 
                        To group radio buttons together, we assign them the same name and only one 
                        radio button from that group can be selected.

                    checkbox-for creating checkbox
                        has id-same as for of label match
                        there are assigned values to the value attribute of the checkboxes. 
                        These values are not visible on the form itself, that’s why it is important 
                        that we use an associated <label> to identify the checkbox.
                        each <input> has the same value for the name attribute. 
                        Using the same name for each checkbox groups the <input>s together. 
                        However, each <input> has a unique id to pair with a <label>.

                    file-for choosing files
                        has id-same as for of label match
                        accept-to say which are file to be accepted(images/png,... with comma any number we can)

                placeholder-inside it will have in transparent to tell what

                min and maxlength-the min and maxlength what to enter

                required-cant click submit without it

                pattern-mainly in phone and all telling type of pattern what shd be it

                min and max-in number to tell max and min

                value-default value in number type


        select tag-dropdowns<-used for
            attributes
                id-same as input like id
            option tag
                used for having diff options in dropdown has value attribute(default value)


        label tag
            for attribute-connects with the respective control using its ID
                the for ka like alt in img and the for and id in input means when the label clicked
                then the corresponding element should be selected(cursor goes to text)
            Adding a Label
            In the previous exercise we created an <input> element but we didn’t include anything 
            to explain what the <input> is used for. For a user to properly identify an <input>
            we use the appropriately named <label> element.

            The <label> element has an opening and closing tag and displays text that 
            is written between the opening and closing tags. To associate a <label> 
            and an <input>, the <input> needs an id attribute. We then assign the for 
            attribute of the <label> element with the value of the id attribute of <input>, like so:
                <form action="/example.html" method="POST">
                    <label for="meal">What do you want to eat?</label>
                    <br>
                    <input type="text" name="food" id="meal">
                </form>


        textarea tag-for text area like for comments and all
            id=same for matching for in label
            rows and cols telling dimension of the text area
        
        Datalist Input<datalist> tag with input=type
            Even if we have an organized dropdown list, if the list has a lot of options, 
            it could be tedious for users to scroll through the entire list to locate one option. 
            That’s where using the <datalist> element comes in handy.

            The <datalist> is used with an <input type="text"> element. 
                The <input> creates a text field that users can type into and filter options from the <datalist>. 
                Let’s go over a concrete example:
                <form>
                    <label for="city">Ideal city to visit?</label>
                    <input type="text" list="cities" id="city" name="city">

                    <datalist id="cities">
                        <option value="New York City"></option>
                        <option value="Tokyo"></option>
                        <option value="Barcelona"></option>
                        <option value="Mexico City"></option>
                        <option value="Melbourne"></option>
                        <option value="Other"></option>  
                    </datalist>
                </form>
                Notice, in the code above, we have an <input> that has a list attribute. 
                The <input> is associated to the <datalist> via the <input>‘s list attribute and 
                the id of the <datalist>.
                While <select> and <datalist> share some similarities, there are some major differences. 
                In the associated <input> element, users can type in the input field to search for a
                particular option. If none of the <option>s match, the user can still use what they typed in. 
                When the form is submitted, the value of the <input>‘s name and the value of the option selected, 
                or what the user typed in, is sent as a pair.
                
        input and label are self closing
        select option text area are to be closed

<!--
    REVIEW
    The purpose of a <form> is to allow users to input information and send it.
    1.The <form>‘s action attribute determines where the form’s information goes.
    2.The <form>‘s method attribute determines how the information is sent and processed.
    3.To add fields for users to input information we use the <input> element and set the type attribute to a field of our choosing:
    4.Setting type to "text" creates a single row field for text input.
    5.Setting type to "password" creates a single row field that censors text input.
    6.Setting type to "number" creates a single row field for number input.
    7.Setting type to "range" creates a slider to select from a range of numbers.
    8.Setting type to "checkbox" creates a single checkbox that can be paired with other checkboxes.
    9.Setting type to "radio" creates a radio button that can be paired with other radio buttons.
    10.Setting type to "text" and adding the list attribute will pair the <input> with a <datalist> element if the list of <input> and the id of <datalist> are the same.
    11.Setting type to "submit" creates a submit button.
    12.A <select> element is populated with <option> elements and renders a dropdown list selection.
    13.A <datalist> element is populated with <option> elements and works with an <input> to search through choices.
    14.A <textarea> element is a text input field that has a customizable area.
    15.When a <form> is submitted, the name of the fields that accept input and the value of those fields are sent as name=value pairs.

    Form Validations
    1.Use of Required word
    2.Use of min and max in number or use of minimumlength and maximumlength in text and all
    3.password mai also max and minlength and patterns and all

    imp points in form validations are
    1.Client-side validations happen in the browser before information is sent to a server.
    2.Adding the required attribute to an input related element will validate that the input field has information in it.
    3.Assigning a value to the min attribute of a number input element will validate an acceptable minimum value.
    4.Assigning a value to the max attribute of a number input element will validate an acceptable maximum value.
    5.Assigning a value to the minlength attribute of a text input element will validate an acceptable minimum number of characters.
    6.Assigning a value to the maxlength attribute of a text input element will validate an acceptable maximum number of characters.
    7.Assigning a regex to pattern matches the input to the provided regex.
    8.If validations on a <form> do not pass, the user gets a message explaining why and the <form> cannot be submitted.
