        <!--table-> table tag creating
            tr-> table row
            th->table header(column ka type)
            td->table data 
            border,align,width are attributes
            each tr tag is one row first row we make header so th tag inside first tr
            rest tr we make td use to say table data 
            can add more rows by more tr adding


            border in table tells the border
            align says the content alignment in its cell can be center right and all
            width gives the width of column
            obviously for each we can add style and other css

            thead tag to tell the heading(only col heading go in thead i.e with scope="col" only
            rows ka in body)
            tbody has all body
            these two learn more(not more often needed presumed)
            we can have footer also
            <tfoot> tag mainly to section the last row like has sum total and all 
            head,body,foot are used to section the tables

  <table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th scope="col">Saturday</th>
    <th scope="col">Sunday</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>

</table>
    First, a new row was added to hold the three headings:
    a blank heading, a Saturday heading, and a Sunday heading.
    The blank heading creates the extra table cell necessary to align the table headings correctly
    over the data they correspond to.
    In the second row, one table heading was added as a row title: Temperature

    Note, also, the use of the scope attribute, which can take one of two values:
    row - this value makes it clear that the heading is for a row.
    col - this value makes it clear that the heading is for a column.

    Spanning Columns
    What if the table contains data that spans multiple columns?

    For example, a personal calendar could have events that span across multiple hours,
    or even multiple days.

    Data can span columns using the colspan attribute.
    The attribute accepts an integer (greater than or equal to 1) to denote the number 
    of columns it spans across.
    ex:
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Monday</th>
            <th>Tuesday</th>
            <th>Wednesday</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="2">Out of Town</td> will be for moday and tuesday together
            <td>Back in Town</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
-->

<!--
    Spanning Rows
    Data can also span multiple rows using the rowspan attribute.

    The rowspan attribute is used for data that spans multiple rows 
    (perhaps an event goes on for multiple hours on a certain day).
    It accepts an integer (greater than or equal to 1) to denote the number of rows it spans across.
    ex:
    <table>
            <tr> 
                <th></th>
                <th>Saturday</th>
                <th>Sunday</th>
            </tr>
            <tr> 
                <th>Morning</th>
                <td rowspan="2">Work</td>
                <td rowspan="3">Relax</td>
            </tr>
            <tr> 
                <th>Afternoon</th>
            </tr>
            <tr> 
                <th>Evening</th>
                <td>Dinner</td>
            </tr>
    </table>

<!--
    1.The <table> element creates a table.
    2.The <tr> element adds rows to a table.
    3.To add data to a row, you can use the <td> element.
    4.Table headings clarify the meaning of data. Headings are added with the <th> element.
    5.Table data can span columns using the colspan attribute.
    6.Table data can span rows using the rowspan attribute.
    7.Tables can be split into three main sections: a head, a body, and a footer.
    8.A table’s head is created with the <thead> element.
    9.A table’s body is created with the <tbody> element.
    10.A table’s footer is created with the <tfoot> element.
    11.All the CSS properties you learned about in this course can be applied to tables and their data.
